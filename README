[[http://www.kim-minh.com/pub/greyfix/][Greyfix]] is the greylisting policy daemon for [[http://www.postfix.org/][Postfix]] written by
[[http://www.kim-minh.com/][Kim Minh Kaplan]].  [[http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/][Greylisting]] is an anti spam technique described by
Evan Harris.  Postfix is a popular mail transport agent developped by
[[http://www.porcupine.org/wietse/][Wietse Zweitze Venema]].  Greyfix uses Postfix policy mechanism to
enable greylisting with Postfix.

<contents depth="1">

It is recommended that you use at least version 0.3.8.

* Latest version

[[http://www.kim-minh.com/pub/greyfix/greyfix-0.3.9.tar.gz][greyfix-0.3.9.tar.gz]] ([[http://www.kim-minh.com/pub/greyfix/greyfix-0.3.9.tar.gz.asc][PGP signature]])

   - BUGFIX: when greylisting by network prefix (option -/) Greyfix
     would treat all IPv6 addresses as "" (empty string) [[[http://trac.kim-minh.com/greyfix/ticket/9][Ticket #9]]].

     
* Features

   - Low and tunable resource usage and high efficiency.  The program
     is written in C and uses Berkeley DB to track mailers.  By itself it
     allocates memory only for a single request and the Berkeley DB library
     can be configured to use very little RAM.
   - Integrates with Postfix's master daemon.  Postfix will shutdown
     greyfix when it is not used completely freeing its runtime
     resources.
   - No administrative burden.  Everything happens "automagically".
   - No need for a database server.  Uses Berkeley DB which is already
     installed with most free Unix distributions.

* Requirements

   - [[http://www.postfix.org/][Postfix 2.1]] or later.  Greyfix is designed exclusively for it.
     It will *not* work with other mailers.

   - [[http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/index.html][Berkeley DB 4.0]] or later.  Chances are you already have it.

* Quickstart

Greyfix uses GNU's build system.  To install the greyfix daemon just
type the following commands:

<example>
    $ gzip -cd greyfix-0.3.9.tar.gz | tar xf -
    $ cd greyfix-0.3.9
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ su -c 'make install'
</example>

Edit Postfix's master configuration file, =/etc/postfix/master.cf=, and
add the following (if you are running Solaris see below):

<example>
greyfix    unix  -       n       n       -       -       spawn
  user=nobody argv=/usr/local/sbin/greyfix -/ 24
</example>

Edit Postfix's main configuration file, =/etc/postfix/main.cf= and add
the following (not for Solaris):

<example>
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,
  reject_unauth_destination,
  check_policy_service unix:private/greyfix
</example>

If there is already a =smtpd_recipient_restrictions= configuration line
you should edit it rather than add a new one.  The important part for
greyfix is that you should add <code>check_policy_service
unix:private/greyfix</code> to it.

Finally have postfix reload its configuration with <code>postfix
reload</code>.

** Solaris

A user reported a [[http://trac.kim-minh.com/greyfix/ticket/4][Corrupted DB on x64 Solaris 10 U4]].  If you want to
help me track this, please contact [[mailto:kaplan+greyfix@kim-minh.com][me]].

http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html has some important
note for Solaris.  The important thing to note is that Solaris
UNIX-domain sockets do not work reliably. Use TCP sockets instead.
Here is what you should add to your =/etc/postfix/master.cf=:

<example>
127.0.0.1:9998  inet  n       n       n       -       9       spawn
  user=nobody argv=/usr/local/sbin/greyfix -/ 24
</example>

and to your =/etc/postfix/main.cf=:

<example>
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,
  reject_unauth_destination,
  check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:9998
127.0.0.1:9998_time_limit = 3600
</example>

* Theory of operation

  MX 20 mx2.example.org

** Why
   Great, now you've created twice the work for yourself.
   
   It is a pretty good assumption that almost anybody with starttls working
   correctly knows what he's doing, so why not exchange email directly with such servers?

   Generate an ipset table
** Benefits
   - Send/recieve mail faster
   - Send/recieve mail more securely
   - Stop random spam COLD.
** More usage

* Usage

<example>
greyfix [-V] [-v] [-d] [-h <Berkeley DB home directory>] [-g <greylist delay>]
    [-b <bloc maximum idle>] [-p <pass maximum idle>] [-r <reject action>]
    [-G <greylisted action>] [-/ <network bits>] [--dump-triplets] [--help]

    -b <seconds>, --bloc-max-idle <seconds>

	This determines how many seconds of life are given to a record
	that is created from a new mail (ip, from, to) triplet.  Note
	that the window created by this setting for passing mails is
	reduced by the amount set for --greylist-delay.  NOTE: See
	also --pass-max-idle.  Defaults to 18000 (5 hours).

    -d, --debug

	Debug logging

    -g <seconds>, --greylist-delay <seconds>

	This determines how many seconds we will block inbound mail
	that is from a previously unknown (ip, from, to) triplet.  If
	it is set to zero, incoming mail association will be learned,
	but no deliveries will be tempfailed.  Use a setting of zero
	with caution, as it will learn spammers as well as legitimate
	senders.  Defaults to 3480 (58 minutes).

    -h <Berkeley DB home directory>, --home <Berkeley DB home directory>

	Location of the Berkeley DB environment home location (the
	default is autoconf's $localstatedir/greyfix
	i.e. /usr/local/var/lib/greyfix).

    --help

        Show usage information.

    -p <seconds>, --pass-max-idle <seconds>

	How much life (in secs) to give to a record we are updating
	from an allowed (passed) email.

	The default is 36 days, which should be enough to handle
	messages that may only be sent once a month, or on things like
	the first monday of the month (which sometimes means 5 weeks).
	Plus, we add a day for a delivery buffer.

    -r <reject action>, --reject-action <reject action>

        The reject action directive that will be used.  See access(5)
        for valid actions.  The string expands %d to the number of
        seconds, %p to the empty string if %d expands to 1 or "s"
        otherwise, %s to " " and %% to "%".

        The default is "DEFER_IF_PERMIT Greylisted by Greyfix X.Y.Z,
        try again in %d second%p.  See
        http://www.kim-minh.com/pub/greyfix/ for more information.".
        http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/schema/whitelist_ip.txt?r1=1.10&r2=1.11
        suggests that a 451 SMTP error code is a better idea.

    -G <greylisted action>, --greylisted-action <greylisted action>

        The action that will be used the first time a triplet passes
        greylisting.  Same expansion as for --reject-action.

        The default is "PREPEND X-Greyfix: Greylisted by Grefix X.Y.Z
        for %d second%p.  See http://www.kim-minh.com/pub/greyfix/ for
        more information."

    -v, --verbose

	Verbose logging

    -V, --version

        Show version information.

    -/ <nbits>, --network-prefix <nbits>

	Only consider the first <nbits> bits of an IPv4 address.
	Defaults to 32 i.e. the whole adresse is significant.

    --dump-triplets

        Dump the triplets database to stdout.  Mostly for debugging
        purposes.
</example>

* Notes

GNU Autoconf's default value for =$(localstatedir)= is
=/usr/local/var/lib= which is quite different from what most Unix
distribution use.  You'll probably want to invoke configure like this:

<example>
    $ ./configure --localstatedir=/var/lib
</example>

This makes Greyfix DB be located in =/var/lib/greyfix=.  Alternatively
you can use the =-h <DB home>= command line option but do not forget
to create the directory and give it correct permissions so that
Greyfix can access it.

Greyfix uses syslog with facility =LOG_MAIL=.  As such the log messages
should appear along postfix's.

If you log messages with DEBUG serverity you will see some messages
saying something like "DEBUG: BDB-16: db_env->remove returned: Device
busy".  They are *not* error messages and are normal when multiple
greyfix daemons operate concurrently.

You should use some whitelisting of some sort for some servers.  A
good starting base is [[http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/schema/whitelist_ip.txt?rev=HEAD][whitelist_ip.txt]].

* TODO

   - Real documentation
   - Statistic collection
   - Distribute triplets to other MX.
   - Auto whitelisting of mail relays that pass greylisting repeatedly
   - SPF?  This could render <code>--network-prefix</code> unnecessary,
   - Use Milter protocol?
   - Support <code>--network-prefix</code> with IPv6.
   - How to do a DEFER_WITH_451_IF_PERMIT? (see
     http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/schema/whitelist_ip.txt?r1=1.10&r2=1.11
     and
     http://lists.puremagic.com/pipermail/greylist-users/2004-September/000766.html).

      - Do not block emails if there is an error.  Previous versions
	would die.  This would cause Postfix's smtpd to reply with an
	error code 500 and the email would bounce.  Now Greyfix will log
	a warning and let the email continue.
